# Awesome Pagination for Gatsby

Love Gatsby, wanna paginate?! Sweet, that's exactly what this package is for.

We differ from other pagination options as follows:

* Don't abuse context to pass data into components
* Pass only pagination context via context
* Provide helpers for next / previous links
