# Awesome Pagination for Gatsby

Love Gatsby, wanna paginate. Sweet, that's exactly what this package is for.

We differ from other pagination options as follows:

* Don't abuse context to pass data into components
* Pass only pagination context via context
* Provide helpers for next / previous links

There are 2 types of pagination. You have 80 blog posts and you want to show them 15 at a time on pages like /blog, /blog/2, /blog/3, etc. You do this with paginate(). Then on each blog post, you want to link to the previous and next blog posts. You do this with createPagePerItem().
